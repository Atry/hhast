HHAST is closely coupled to Hack's syntax tree, so if the schema of `hh_parse` changes, HHAST needs updating.

There is a [update-schema](https://github.com/hhvm/hhast/blob/27318055fd122777e8279c673ee2d578d32cbc03/.github/workflows/build-and-test.yml#L45) GitHub Action job to create Pull Requests to update the schema. 

- It is executed everyday to create pull requests to update schema if it the schema changes. The job does not know whether the change is backward compatible, therefore it creates two pull requests, one for breaking change and one for backward compatible change. The maintainer can review the PRs to merge one of them. For example: https://github.com/hhvm/hhast/pull/481 and https://github.com/hhvm/hhast/pull/480.
  - If the maintainer decide to merge the PR to update schema to a backward compatible version, and `SCHEMA_VERSION` is changed, the maintainer should also [tag a `vx.yyy.z` HHAST release](https://github.com/hhvm/hhast/releases/new), where `x.yyy` should be the required HHVM version in https://github.com/hhvm/hhast/blob/main/composer.json#L24, and `z` is the next previous version number plus 1.
  - If the maintainer decide to merge the PR to update schema with a breaking change, the maintainer should also tag a `vx.yyy.0` HHAST release, where `x.yyy` should be the required HHVM version in https://github.com/hhvm/hhast/blob/main/composer.json#L24.
- The job `update-schema` is also executed when pushing a commit to any branch in either this repository or a forked repository. When a commit is pushed and the schema change is detected, the pull requests in that repository are created against that branch.
